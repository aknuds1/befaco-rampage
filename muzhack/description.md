# Rampage

**Please note that this is an unofficial project page, the official one is [here](http://www.befaco.org/en/spring-reverb/).**

**The Rampage** is Befaco’s approach to an old invention: the Serge/Buchla ramp generator.

We took the idea of a “patch programmable” function generator/processor, put two units in the same module and tried to expand them with new funky functions and ways to combine them: Slope detectors, analogue logic functions and a few extra outputs to add some more complex features.

The module is built around two voltage controlled integrators. Integrators (also known as Lag Processors or Slew limiters) allow you to process your voltages, converting sharp square waves in ramp-like waveforms.

These lovely devices can, for instance, convert a gate signal into a simple envelope, or achieve a “portamento” or “glide” effect when applied to pitch CV. Other well known application of an integrator is it’s ability to low-pass filter an audio signal. Further information and example patches can be found in the user manual.
