summary: "The Rampage is Befaco’s approach to an old invention: the Serge/Buchla ramp generator. We took the idea of a “patch programmable” function generator/processor, put two units in the same module and tried to expand them with new funky functions and ways to combine them: Slope detectors, analogue logic functions and a few extra outputs to add some more complex features."
